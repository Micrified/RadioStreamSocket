# Radio Stream Socket

The program in this repository connects to an internet radio website, and then dispatches a GET request for a particular radio stream. This stream is then downloaded and a byte counter incremented in set steps.


### Building

Invoke `build.sh` in the repository to compile it. Just outputs the executable `stream`.
